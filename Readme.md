Efficient public transportation is crucial in Delhi NCR. This article explores how to calculate and visualize metro accessibility using 3D mapping techniques, providing insights into travel times to the nearest metro station.

### Outline
**For this tutorial, we will cover the following steps:**
1. Getting Started: Overview of Python, Pandana, and OSMnx libraries.
2. Data Collection: Fetching metro station locations and road networks using OSMnx.
3. Data Preparation: Cleaning and visualizing data on a 2D map.
4. Calculating Accessibility: Using Pandana to calculate travel times.
5. 3D Visualization: Visualizing accessibility data in 3D

### Data Collection
We use OSMnx to fetch metro station locations and the road network of Delhi NCR, forming the basis for our accessibility calculations.

### Why Determine Metro Accessibility?
Determining metro accessibility in an urban city is essential for effective urban planning, real estate valuation, and economic development. It helps identify underserved areas, reduce traffic congestion, and lower carbon emissions. Additionally, it enables residents to make informed decisions about where to live and work, enhancing overall quality of life.

### Conclusion
We demonstrated how to calculate and visualize metro accessibility in Delhi NCR using Python libraries like OSMnx, Pandana, H3, and Pydeck, contributing to more connected and sustainable urban environments.
