## Subtitle: A Comprehensive Guide to Calculating and Visualizing Metro Accessibility in Delhi NCR Using 3D Mapping

### Introduction
In the bustling urban landscape of an urban area like Delhi NCR, efficient and accessible public transportation is crucial for the daily commute of millions. The Delhi Metro, with its extensive network, plays a pivotal role in connecting various parts of the region. However, understanding and visualizing the accessibility of metro stations can be a complex task. This article delves into the methodology of calculating metro accessibility across Delhi NCR and demonstrates how to visualize this data in a 3D map. By leveraging advanced mapping techniques, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of how accessible different areas are in terms of travel time to the nearest metro station. Join us as we explore the intersection of urban planning, data analysis, and 3D visualization to enhance our understanding of metro accessibility in one of India's most dynamic regions.

### Outline
**For this tutorial, we will cover the following steps:**
1. **Getting Started**: Overview of Python, Pandana, and OSMnx libraries, and setting up a Google Notebook instance for the project.
2. **Data Collection**: Using OSMnx to fetch metro station locations and extract the entire road network of Delhi NCR from OpenStreetMap.
3. **Data Preparation**: Cleaning and organizing data for analysis, and initially visualizing metro stations and road networks on a 2D map.
4. **Calculating Accessibility**: Understanding accessibility metrics and using Pandana to calculate travel time to the nearest metro station.
5. **3D Visualization**: Exploring the benefits and tools for 3D mapping, and visualizing accessibility data in 3D using appropriate libraries.

### Data Collection
In this step, we will gather the essential data needed for our analysis. We'll start by using the OSMnx library to fetch the locations of metro stations across Delhi NCR. This data will provide the foundation for our accessibility calculations. Additionally, we'll extract the entire road network of the region from OpenStreetMap, which will allow us to accurately model travel routes and distances. By the end of this step, we'll have a comprehensive dataset ready for further processing and analysis.

### Why Determine Metro Accessibility?
Determining metro accessibility in an urban city is essential for effective urban planning, real estate valuation, and economic development. It helps identify underserved areas, reduce traffic congestion, and lower carbon emissions. Additionally, it enables residents to make informed decisions about where to live and work, enhancing overall quality of life.

### Conclusion
In this article, we explored the methodology for calculating and visualizing metro accessibility in the Delhi NCR region using advanced Python libraries. By leveraging tools like OSMnx, Pandana, H3, and Pydeck, we demonstrated how to efficiently gather data, perform accessibility calculations, and create engaging 3D visualizations.
